To delete items older than 30 days

# Get-PnPRecycleBinItem -SecondStage | where-object {$_.deleteddate -lt (Get-date).Adddays(-30)} | select Title, ItemType, Size, ItemState, DirName, deleteddate

# Get-PnPRecycleBinItem -SecondStage | where-object {$_.deleteddate -lt (Get-date).Adddays(-30)} | Clear-PnPRecycleBinItem -secondstageonly


I have variable $siteurl so -connection can be used in pnjp cmdlets . This is to ensure script is only targetting desired URL.
